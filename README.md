# Portfolio Website

This the source code of [rakeshs.eu.org](https://rakeshs.eu.org), my portfolio website.

## How to build

To build you will need `npm` (or `yarn`) and `nodejs` installed.

1. Run:
```shell
npm install
# or yarn
```
2. To build static website run:
```shell
npm build
# or yarn run build
```

## Todo

[ ] Add Sakura falling animation.
[ ] Add a website footer.
[ ] Add Blog link.

## What's Changed?

- We are using `react-three-fiber` instead for better react component integration.
- We are using `react-cssfx-loading` for loading animations instead of framer motion.
- Complete UI created from scratch.
